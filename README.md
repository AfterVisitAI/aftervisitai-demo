# AfterVisitAI — Demo (Public Overview)

AfterVisitAI is a **patient-first comprehension layer** that turns complex medical visit notes into **clear, trusted after-visit guidance** — verified against **CDC, NIH, and ADA** sources.  
It helps patients leave every appointment with confidence, not confusion.

> **Problem:** Patients remember only 20–60% of what clinicians say — and much of that is misremembered.  
> **Solution:** AfterVisitAI provides evidence-anchored summaries that translate medical complexity into everyday clarity.
